          The Polkadot Technical Fellowship has adopted a governance model where
          the votes are weighted based on the rank of individual members.
          Referenda are managed by different origins and tracks, each with its
          own approval and support parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that members of the Fellowship can only vote
          on Fellowship proposals that are available for their given rank.

          Overview

        <p>
          Sub-treasury spends can be requested in DOT and other assets owned by
          the Sub-treasury account on AssetHub. Spends are executed by the
          Fellowship Treasury pallet which has no burning mechanism, no spend
          periods, and no Payout periods.

          10 general proposals (including whitelisting and treasury proposals)
          can be simultaneously voted on, as shown below (Subsquare UI).
