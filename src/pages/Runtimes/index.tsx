        contains the various runtimes which make up the core subsystems of
        networks for which the Polkadot Technical Fellowship is represented. Its

        and Kusama Governance.

        The approval rights for PRs are configured in a review-bot that uses the
        on-chain identity to map from a GitHub account to a Fellowship member.
        This requires that Fellowship members add their GitHub handle to their
        on-chain identity.

        Ecosystem-wide collaboration
      </h1>
      <p>
        At times, runtime releases will contain breaking changes and/or
        temporary disruptions that have the potential to adversely affect the
        builders and service providers that operate in the Polkadot ecosystem at
        large.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve the release process and ensure that scheduled upgrades with
        breaking changes and/or temporary disruptions do not dramatically impact
        existing teams, targeted messages are sent to Wallets, UIs and
        Explorers, DEXes, CEXes and Custodians, Parachains, Live networks, and
        various builders.
