# Runtimes

The [`polkadot-fellows/runtimes`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes) repository contains the various runtimes which make up the core subsystems of
networks for which the Polkadot Technical Fellowship is represented. Its
maintenance is overseen by the Fellowship, as decreed by the Polkadot
and Kusama Governance.


The approval rights for PRs are configured in a review-bot that uses the
on-chain identity to map from a GitHub account to a Fellowship member.
This requires that Fellowship members add their GitHub handle to their
on-chain identity.


# Runtime release process


The release process builds all runtimes and then puts them into a
release in this github repository. <b>
All PRs submitted for the runtime release require a CHANGELOG entry.</b>

There are guidelines for both Major and Minor releases which include
recommended steps for managing and communicating breaking changes and
disruptions.

# Ecosystem-wide collaboration

At times, runtime releases will contain breaking changes and/or
temporary disruptions that have the potential to adversely affect the
builders and service providers that operate in the Polkadot ecosystem at
large.

To improve the release process and ensure that scheduled upgrades with
breaking changes and/or temporary disruptions do not dramatically impact
existing teams, targeted messages are sent to Wallets, UIs and
Explorers, DEXes, CEXes and Custodians, Parachains, Live networks, and
various builders.
